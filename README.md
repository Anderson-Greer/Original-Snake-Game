# Original-Snake-Game
This repository is home to my 100% self-made snake game. 
There is 1 simple python file that implements the pygame library to recreate the famous game.

In case you don't know what snake is:
    The player controls a line(snake) that is moved using 4 keys(in this case the 4 arrow keys).
        The snake is usually a couple pixels long when it starts.
        
    The objective of the game is to make the longest snake possible.
        The snake gets longer whenever it crosses an apple.
        An apple is typically 1 pixel.
    
    The game ends once the snake leaves the screen or crosses itself.
    
Specifications:
    The grid is 800x800, or 50x50 pixels.
    The apple is 1 red pixel.
    The snake is initially 1 blue pixel and gains 5 pixels whenever it consumes an apple.
